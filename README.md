# Seb's animal tech task

Loading up the app presents you with a message informing you that you have no pets.
Clicking the "Add Animal" button brings out a side drawer where the name and breed of your pet can be chosen.

Once added, the drawer closes and the pet can be seen in the main screen.
The stat levels of dogs, cats & snakes change at different rates.
Multiple animals can be added, and they will be shown alongside each other.

As levels change, the colours of the bar also change to indicate their severity.

Tests can be run with `npm run test` which utilises `vitest`
