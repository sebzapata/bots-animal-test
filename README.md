# Animals Sample App 🐩

> _What could be more fun than having a pet? Making your own!_

## What Is This?

Your job is to create your own digital pet platform using this codebase as a starting point - how you continue is up to you!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project
2. Run `bun install`
3. Write some magic to make your pets come alive!
4. Push up to a brand new repo and send us a link

## The Brief

- Users should be able to name animals
- Users should be able to have multiple animals of different types
- Playing with animals makes them happy
- Feeding animals makes them less hungry
- Resting animals makes them less sleepy
- Animals start "neutral" on all metrics
- Happiness should decrease over time
- Hunger should increase over time
- Sleepiness should increase over time
- Happiness should decrease faster when sleep or hunger is full
- Each animal type should have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates

## Judging Criteria

- All points in the brief have been followed and work as described
- The main functionality and business logic should be tested. Each bullet point in the brief should be tested explicitly
- Use of 3rd party libraries is permitted but should be kept to a minimum - we would like to see what you are capable of!
- We also look at project structure, code clarity, type quality, use of bad practices and bugs.
- Solutions forking or PRing back to the main repo will be disqualified - please upload to a new repo
