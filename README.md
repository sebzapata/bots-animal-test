# Seb's animal tech task

Loading up the app presents you with a message informing you that you have no pets.
Clicking the "Add Animal" button brings out a side drawer where the name and breed of your pet can be chosen.

Once added, the drawer closes and the pet can be seen in the main screen.
The stat levels of dogs, cats & snakes change at different rates.
Multiple animals can be added, and they will be shown alongside each other.

As levels change, the colours of the bar also change to indicate their severity.
At the moment, this is rather fast for demonstration purposes, but would be reduced for use in real life.

Tests can be run with `npm run test` which utilises `vitest`

Future work would include an option to view the pets in an image carousel or in a grid, and also saving the state of the app into local state or a database which would allow the user to close the page, come back to it later and continue where they left off.
There are other features I have thought about adding, which I would be happy to discuss too.
